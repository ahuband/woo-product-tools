### Description

This started off as a simple plugin for WooCommerce that would change the product title in the cart to help prevent cart abandonment. The idea is that once a user gets to the cart page, viewing only the product title without any of the benefits makes it less likely for them to click the buy button. 

It's currently being developed into a small suite of tools to improve single product management in WooCommerce.

### Installation

1. Upload `/woocommerce-product-cart-title/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

### Frequently Asked Questions 

1. Is there more coming to this plugin? Maybe! We'll see how the basic one goes.
