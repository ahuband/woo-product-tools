This is a simple plugin for WooCommerce that will change the product title in the cart to help prevent cart abandonment.

== Description ==

This is a simple plugin for WooCommerce that will change the product title in the cart to help prevent cart abandonment. The idea is that once a user gets to the cart page, viewing only the product title without any of the benefits makes it less likely for them to click the buy button. 

This plugin adds a single metabox to the product pages called "Cart Title." Here you can add a new title that show the benefits of your product, right in the cart.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `wc-cpn.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
